The Functions I decided to keep in Functions.Java besides the Create Functions which we were instructed to keep there were: 

getImageList() I really wanted to put this in action because it is passed the ImageStore object. But when I moved it I wasn’t able to get VirtualWorld to interface with this function throw the action object. Because of this, I left it in Functions

getImages() I left this in because no of the objects had a Map<String, List<PImage>> images as part of their data.

setAlpha() I left this in because non of the data passed in was part of any of my other objects

I decided to leave the execute functions in Actions because It had entity, world, imageStore as data in the object. All of which are used in these functions. This way I would only have to pass in the  EventScheduler object.
